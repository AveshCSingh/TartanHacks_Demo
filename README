This code was used for a short Rails tutorial at TartanHacks. It was built on:
     Ruby: 1.9.2
     Rails: 3.1.3

 To run the code, clone the repository and run:

rake db:migrate
rails s

--

The following process was used to create this demo app. If you have any questions, email avesh@cmu.edu, or come find me at TartanHacks.

rails new debt_app

rails s; Go to localhost:3000

rails generate scaffold user name:string email:string

[Show migration in db/migrate]

rake db:migrate

[Show new code in controller and view]

rake routes

rake db:migrate

Create new user over terminal

Add SSN to app/views/_form.html.erb
Add SSN to app/views/show.html.erb

rails generate scaffold debt amount:integer user_id:integer
Add to models/debt.rb:
  belongs_to :user
